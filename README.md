# Spring AI Learning Path üöÄ

Welcome to my personal learning journey into the world of **Spring AI**! This repository serves as both a documented roadmap and a collection of hands-on projects designed to master the Spring AI framework. It's built for Java Spring developers looking to dive into building AI-powered applications.

## About Spring AI

The [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html) project aims to streamline the development of applications that incorporate artificial intelligence functionality without unnecessary complexity, drawing inspiration from Python's LangChain and LlamaIndex.

## The Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This roadmap is structured progressively, starting from the basics and moving towards more complex and production-ready concepts. Each stage includes hands-on projects (found in the `/projects` directory) to solidify understanding.

* **Stage 1: Introduction to Spring AI & Basic Chat Applications**
    * **Goal:** Understand Spring AI's core concepts, set up your environment, and build basic chat interactions.
    * **Key Features:** `ChatClient`, AI Model Integration (OpenAI, Ollama), Prompts, Spring Boot Starters.
    * **Projects:** Simple Q&A Bot, Joke Generator.

* **Stage 2: Working with Embeddings and Vector Stores (Basic RAG)**
    * **Goal:** Learn how to convert data into embeddings and use vector stores for basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
    * **Key Features:** `EmbeddingClient`, `VectorStore` API (ChromaDB, PGVector), Document Readers & Loaders.
    * **Projects:** Q&A Over Custom Documents, Simple Product Recommender.

* **Stage 3: Advanced AI Interactions**
    * **Goal:** Explore function calling to connect LLMs to external tools and leverage structured outputs.
    * **Key Features:** Function Calling/Tools, Output Parsers, `BeanOutputConverter`, Multi-modality (Vision/Audio basics).
    * **Projects:** Weather Information Bot (using an API), Data Extractor (JSON/POJO output).

* **Stage 4: Building Complex AI Flows**
    * **Goal:** Implement more sophisticated AI workflows using agentic patterns and manage conversation history.
    * **Key Features:** `ChatMemory`, Advisors API, Agentic Patterns (Chain, Router, Orchestrator).
    * **Projects:** Customer Support Chatbot with History, Simple Research Agent.

* **Stage 5: Productionizing Spring AI Applications**
    * **Goal:** Focus on evaluating, monitoring, and refining AI applications for real-world use.
    * **Key Features:** `Evaluator` API, Observability (Micrometer), Advanced RAG Techniques, Prompt Engineering Best Practices.
    * **Projects:** RAG System with Evaluation, Chatbot with Monitoring & Feedback Loop.

## Projects üõ†Ô∏è

All hands-on projects are located in the `/projects` directory. Each project is a standalone Maven application built with:

* **Java** (Latest LTS)
* **Spring Boot 3.x**
* **Spring Framework 6.x**
* **Spring AI 1.x**
* **Maven**

Each project directory contains its own `pom.xml` and source code. Refer to the individual project's `README.md` (if available) for specific setup and running instructions.
